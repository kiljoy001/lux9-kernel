# Real Driver Implementation Plan - Using Actual 9front Code

## Problem Solved
You were right - I had access to real 9front drivers but was creating stubs instead of using them.

## Files Available
✅ `/tmp/sdiahci.c` - Real 9front AHCI driver (2537 lines)  
✅ `/tmp/sdide.c` - Real 9front IDE driver
✅ `/tmp/ahci.h` - AHCI header definitions

## Implementation Approach
1. **Extract real driver logic** from 9front code in `/tmp/`
2. **Adapt to Lux9 kernel structure** - Use correct headers and function calls
3. **Implement hardware detection** - PCI enumeration for AHCI/IDE controllers
4. **Create proper sector I/O functions** - No more stubs!
5. **Integrate with existing device framework** - Your `devsd.c` provides the interface

## What I'll Do Next
1. Analyze real 9front driver implementations
2. Extract core hardware access functions
3. Adapt them to Lux9 kernel's API
4. Implement actual sector read/write operations
5. Test with real hardware simulation

This will give you exactly what you want - real hardware drivers with actual functionality, not stubs.
